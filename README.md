# translator-bot
## Inspiration
I have been using discord for a long time and have always been fascinated with the bots created by other people. I wanted to try creating one on my own and this hackathon gave me a chance to do just that.
## What it does
As the name suggests, it is kind of like a translator tool that uses APIs to produce results in supported languages. It also has a command to perform "spinning" on the given text which replaces words with their synonyms to make it look original. Other than that, there are also some commands to convert your text into funny versions such as pirate talk, Shakespeare-like English, etc.
## How we built it
Using [discord.py by Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was I have never used python much and discord.py is based entirely on it. Googling the basic syntax was quite an ordeal. One other thing was that it was really hard to find free APIs which did what I wanted. After spending a lot of time, I found some APIs that worked but they had imposed limitations on the usage because it was free. That being my only choice, I had to work with it. Hosting the bot was a small challenge but that was mostly because it was my first time doing it.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully completed my first project in Python. Hosted a functional Discord bot (ignoring some bugs)
## What we learned
Learned some new concepts and modules to work with in Python. Also learned the process of making a basic discord bot and working with APIs.
## What's next for Translator Discord Bot
The next best thing for Translator Bot would be me learning DL and deploying my own APIs to overcome the problem of usage limitations of the free APIs. But for the near future, adding some new commands and solving pre-existing bugs such as multiple commands at once, better error handling, etc. would be my objective.
